# Rock-Paper-Scissors-ODIN
Simple JavaScript project. Play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer!
The first version of the game was played inside the browser's own console.
The updated version has user interface, 80% of the code is rewritten (reworked).

Things I learnt from this simple project include:

- Usage of simple functions
- Implementation of If..else conditionals
- Working with function parameters, arguments and callbacks
- Using git branches to maintain clear modifications of the code
